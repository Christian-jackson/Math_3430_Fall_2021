A project that I would find really cool to do is to
make a program that would be a plug-in in Runelight.
Runelight is a program that runs Runescape that has
plugins made by users that make the game more fun
to play, since it's a game that came out in 2006-2007,
but doesn't have any cheats. It just has stuff that 
would make it more user friendly to players. Also,
since Runescape is a MMO, like other MMO's it gives
you items based on RNG, all praise RNGesus. So each
time you complete a task or kill something you have a 
certain percent chance of getting the item that you 
actually want. So, the plug-in that I would want to 
make would give an overlay on the game and tell you
what the odds are of getting the item you want. Since
the game keeps track of how many times you've killed 
certain monsters or how many times you completed a task
the plug-in would us that and then put it into a 
statistical program that I have written to give you the
exact percent chance you have on getting the item on the 
next completion. All the data for percent chance of something
dropping in the game is already out on the wiki for the game. 
There is also a calculator of the wiki for it that seems fairly 
accurate, but I dont think there is a plug-in for Runelight yet
that could tell you immediatly in game after each kill/comlpletion.
It would be great for the long grinds of items that have a 1/500 
chance and even better for the ones that are 1/5000 and see the 
you getting closer and closer to being able to get the item.
Also, maybe do something for if you get crazy lucky on getting
an item crazy early. like going for an item that has a 1/5000 
chance, but getting it on like you 45th try. Also, do something
for when you go dry. Like if you have a 1/250 chance of getting
something but haven't gotten it even after 700 kills.
