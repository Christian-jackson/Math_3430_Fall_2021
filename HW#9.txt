Floating point numbers have a few key advantages over fixed point numbers. Floating
point numbers can represent a wider range of values compared to fixed point becuase
it doesn't have a fixed amount of numbers after the decimal like fixed point numbers.
The amount of decimal places changes with the magnitude of the number. Which allows
floating point numbers to represent very large/small numbers better than fixed point.
The disadvantage to using floating point number though is that because of its many 
values it can cause an accurate answer, but it wount be an exact due to it haveing
mulitple values and can end up being less percise at times. So it sacrifieces percision
for range.
