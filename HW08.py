This assignment is due by 11:59pm on 11/19/2021. 

For this assignment you will be writing a python script named LS.py which will
contain several functions. All functions must satisfy the same requirements as in HW03. 

You will import the LA.py and QR.py scripts from the previous homeworks. You must make use of those
functions to implement the functions below. Failure to do this will result in an
earned grade of 0.

For all functions below, matrices will be stored as lists of lists where each
component list represents a column of the matrix. Use of any other
representation will result in an earned grade of 0.

The functions you will need to write are

1) Write a function which takes as it's argument a vector stored as a list, and
a matrix, and returns the least squares solution, calculated by using QR
factorization.
