This assignment is due by 11:59pm on 11/12/2021. 

For this assignment you will be updating the python script QR.py from the
previous homework. As usual, all functions must satisfy the same requirements as in HW03. 

You will import the LA.py script from HW03 and HW04. You must make use of those
functions to implement the functions below. Failure to do this will result in an
earned grade of 0.

For all functions below, matrices will be stored as lists of lists where each
component list represents a column of the matrix. Use of any other
representation will result in an earned grade of 0.

1) Add a function which takes as it's argument a matrix and implements the
Householder Orthogonalization algorithm to calculate the QR
factorization, stored as a list of two matrices Q and R.
